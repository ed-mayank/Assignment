Kibana Learning Roadmap (Beginner to Advanced)

Kibana is a powerful visualization and analytics tool for Elasticsearch. Here's a step-by-step roadmap to learn Kibana from scratch and become proficient.
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Understand the Basics of Kibana and ELK Stack

Before diving into Kibana, you need a basic understanding of the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
âœ… Topics to Cover:

    What is Kibana, and where is it used?
    Overview of the ELK Stack:
        Elasticsearch (Stores and searches data)
        Logstash (Processes and transforms data before sending it to Elasticsearch)
        Kibana (Visualizes the data from Elasticsearch)
    Installation of the ELK Stack

ðŸ“š Resources:

    Elastic Documentation
    YouTube tutorials on "Introduction to Kibana & ELK Stack"
    Set up a local ELK environment (Docker or Manual)

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Installing and Setting Up Kibana

Once you understand the basics, install Kibana and explore the interface.
âœ… Topics to Cover:

    Installing Kibana on Windows/Linux/macOS (or using Docker)
    Connecting Kibana to Elasticsearch
    Exploring the Kibana UI
        Discover
        Visualize
        Dashboard
        Management

ðŸ“š Resources:

    Kibana Installation Guide
    Elastic YouTube Tutorials

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Working with Data in Kibana

Now that you have Kibana set up, start importing and exploring data.
âœ… Topics to Cover:

    Adding data to Elasticsearch (Manual upload, Logstash, Beats)
    Creating and managing Index Patterns
    Understanding Discover (Querying data)
    Using KQL (Kibana Query Language) & Lucene Queries
    Using Filters and Search Operators

ðŸ“š Hands-on Practice:

    Upload sample datasets (Kibana Sample Data)
    Perform searches using Kibana Query Language (KQL)

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Creating Visualizations

Visualization is the core feature of Kibana.
âœ… Topics to Cover:

    Types of Visualizations:
        Bar charts, Pie charts, Line charts
        Heatmaps, Data tables, Maps
        Timelion & Vega (Advanced)
    Creating a Dashboard from multiple visualizations
    Using Lens for easy drag-and-drop visualization

ðŸ“š Hands-on Practice:

    Create a real-time log analysis dashboard
    Experiment with different visualization types

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Building and Managing Dashboards

Kibana Dashboards allow you to combine multiple visualizations in one place.
âœ… Topics to Cover:

    Creating & saving Dashboards
    Adding multiple visualizations to a dashboard
    Configuring dashboard filters & drilldowns
    Sharing dashboards with teams

ðŸ“š Hands-on Practice:

    Build a Server Performance Monitoring Dashboard
    Share the dashboard with different users

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Advanced Features & Security

To use Kibana in enterprise environments, you need security and space management.
âœ… Topics to Cover:

    Spaces in Kibana (Organizing dashboards)
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (Managing user permissions)
    Alerting & Watchers (Automating alerts for log events)
    Canvas for Custom Reports
    Machine Learning in Kibana (Anomaly detection)

ðŸ“š Hands-on Practice:

    Create an alert for high CPU usage in logs
    Set up user roles with restricted access to specific dashboards

ðŸ”¹ Step 7: DevOps & Real-World Use Cases

Once you are comfortable with Kibana, integrate it with real-world systems.
âœ… Topics to Cover:

    Using Beats (Filebeat, Metricbeat, Heartbeat) for log ingestion
    Monitoring Kubernetes & Docker Logs with Kibana
    Integrating Kibana with Grafana
    Automating dashboard deployments using Kibana API

ðŸ“š Hands-on Practice:

    Set up Filebeat to collect logs from a Linux server
    Monitor Nginx access logs in Kibana

ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Mastering Kibana for Security (SIEM)

If you are in Cybersecurity, Kibanaâ€™s SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is crucial.
âœ… Topics to Cover:

    Introduction to Kibana SIEM
    Setting up Security Dashboards
    Using Elastic Security Detection Rules
    Log analysis for threat hunting

ðŸ“š Hands-on Practice:

    Set up a real-time threat monitoring dashboard
    Detect failed SSH login attempts using Kibana queries
